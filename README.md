# Purple Llama

Purple Llama is an umbrella project that over time will bring together tools
and evals to help the community build responsibly with open generative AI
models. The initial release will include tools and evals for Cyber Security and
Input/Output safeguards but we plan to contribute more in the near future.

## Why purple?

Borrowing a [concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab_Fdp6FVDI) from the
cybersecurity world, we believe that to truly mitigate the challenges which
generative AI presents, we need to take both attack (red team) and defensive
(blue team) postures. Purple teaming, composed of both red and blue team
responsibilities, is a collaborative approach to evaluating and mitigating
potential risks and the same ethos applies to generative AI and hence our
investment in Purple Llama will be comprehensive.

## License

Components within the Purple Llama project will be licensed permissively
enabling both research and commercial usage. We believe this is a major step
towards enabling community collaboration and standardizing the development and
usage of trust and safety tools for generative AI development. More concretely
evals and benchmarks are licensed under the MIT license while any models use the
Llama 2 Community license. See the table below:

| **Component Type** |            **Components**            |                                          **License**                                           |

## Evals & Benchmarks

### Cybersecurity

We are sharing what we believe is the first industry-wide set of cybersecurity
safety evaluations for LLMs. These benchmarks are based on industry guidance and
standards (e.g., CWE and MITRE ATT&CK) and built in collaboration with our
security subject matter experts. With this initial release, we aim to provide
tools that will help address some risks outlined in the
[White House commitments on developing responsible AI](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-secures-voluntary-commitments-from-leading-artificial-intelligence-companies-to-manage-the-risks-posed-by-ai/),
including:

Metrics for quantifying LLM cybersecurity risks. Tools to evaluate the frequency
of insecure code suggestions. Tools to evaluate LLMs to make it harder to
generate malicious code or aid in carrying out cyberattacks. We believe these
tools will reduce the frequency of LLMs suggesting insecure AI-generated code
and reduce their helpfulness to cyber adversaries. Our initial results show that
there are meaningful cybersecurity risks for LLMs, both with recommending
insecure code and for complying with malicious requests. See our
[Cybersec Eval paper](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/purple-llama-cyberseceval-a-benchmark-for-evaluating-the-cybersecurity-risks-of-large-language-models/)
for more details.

## Input/Output Safeguards

As we outlined in Llama 2â€™s
[Responsible Use Guide](https://ai.meta.com/llama/responsible-use-guide/), we
recommend that all inputs and outputs to the LLM be checked and filtered in
accordance with content guidelines appropriate to the application.

### Llama Guard

To support this, and empower the community, we are releasing Llama Guard,
an openly-available model that performs competitively on common open benchmarks
and provides developers with a pretrained model to help defend against
generating potentially risky outputs.

As part of our ongoing commitment to open and transparent science, we are
releasing our methodology and an extended discussion of model performance in our
[Llama Guard paper](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-guard-llm-based-input-output-safeguard-for-human-ai-conversations/).
This model has been trained on a mix of publicly-available datasets to enable
detection of common types of potentially risky or violating content that may be
relevant to a number of developer use cases. Ultimately, our vision is to enable
developers to customize this model to support relevant use cases and to make it
easier to adopt best practices and improve the open ecosystem.

## Getting Started

To get started and learn how to use Purple Llama components with Llama models,
see the getting started guide [here](https://ai.meta.com/llama/get-started/).
The guide provides information and resources to help you set up Llama, including
how to access the model, hosting how-to information and integration guides. Additionally,
you will find supplemental materials to further assist you while responsibly
building with Llama. The guide will be updated as more Purple Llama components
get released.

## FAQ

For a running list of frequently asked questions, for not only Purple Llama
components but also generally for Llama models, see the FAQ
